This project introduces a centralized system for logging, tracking, and analyzing vehicle movements at police check posts. Traditional manual logging and fragmented databases often delay security processes and reduce efficiency. Our solution implements an SQL-based check post database integrated with a Python-powered real-time dashboard, enabling faster decision-making, automated alerts, and improved security monitoring.
